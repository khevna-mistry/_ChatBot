# Craft Chatbot Application

This project integrates a **Flask-based Python backend** with an **ASP.NET MVC frontend**, offering users a chatbot that provides information on crafts such as woodwork, pottery, stonework, paintings, and more. It also handles casual conversations like jokes, time, and weather queries.

### Features:
- **Craft-Related Conversations**: Woodwork, pottery, stonework, paintings, and more.
- **Casual Small Talk**: Engages in friendly chats, tells jokes, and offers compliments.
- **Real-Time Information**: Provides time and weather-related responses.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easily send messages and interact with the bot.


### Technology Stack:
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: ASP.NET MVC (C#)
- **Communication**: HTTP POST requests to exchange messages between frontend and backend.

  
### How It Works:
- The **Flask backend** processes user input, interacts with the chatbot logic, and returns a response.
- The **ASP.NET MVC frontend** handles the UI, allowing users to type messages and receive responses.
